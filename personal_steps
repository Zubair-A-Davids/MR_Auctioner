Now run these commands:

1. Delete the test account:

cd server
node scripts/delete-user.js admin@example.com

2. Create your real admin account (use YOUR email and password):
node scripts/create-admin.js YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD "Your Display Name"

The test account credentials aren't a security issue since they're only in your local database, but it's good practice to remove test accounts
